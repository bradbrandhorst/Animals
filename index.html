		<p>Corgis are probably my favorite animal, as evidenced by the fact that I allow one to live in my house. The guy who lives with me is named Orville. He's been living with me since November 2008, when I invited him to crash, and he just never left.</p>
		<p>There are two types of Corgis- Pembroke and Cardigan. Orville is a Cardigan, which means that he has a tail and more rounded ears. Pembroke Corgis, like the ones Queen Elizabeth has, tend to lack tails and have more triangular ears. Pembrokes are more common than Cardigans.</p>
		<p>Corgis are known for their short, stubby legs, and for being able to walk the fine line between annoying and adorable. They're herding dogs, which means they get bored easily if they don't have a project. Orville's project usually involves freaking out about deer or cats in the neighborhood.</p>
